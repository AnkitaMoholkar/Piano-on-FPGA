# Piano-on-FPGA
The goal of this experiment to implement a circuit that generates square waves at specific frequencies based on inputs, and outputs them to headphones using the audio jack present on the Real Digital Blackboard. 
The Real Digital Blackboard is an ARM and FPGA development board based on the ZYNQ 7000 device from Xilinx.
